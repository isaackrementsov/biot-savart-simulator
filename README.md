Calculates the magnetic field for 3d current distributions using the Law of Biot-Savart:

For many simple distributions (such as coils and solenoids), the line integral in this expression is unsolvable with elementary functions for certain points.
Thus, this program provides a useful visualization and solution for any position relative to the object.
Currently only works for curves, but surfaces & regions may be added later.
