Calculates the magnetic field for 3d current distributions using the Law of Biot-Savart:
![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1617660992/render.png)
For many simple distributions (such as coils and solenoids), the line integral in this expression is unsolvable with elementary functions for certain points.
Thus, this program provides a useful visualization and solution for any position relative to the object.
Currently only works for curves, but surfaces & regions may be added later.
